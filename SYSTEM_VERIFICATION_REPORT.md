   - Nancy Wilson, RN (Registered Nurse)
   - System Administrator

4. **Key Navigation**:
   - **Dashboard**: Overview of recent activity
   - **Patients**: Search and view patient records
   - **Encounters**: Schedule and manage appointments
   - **Clinical Workspace**: Access when viewing a patient
   - **FHIR Explorer**: Browse raw FHIR resources
   - **Notifications**: Real-time clinical alerts

## Testing Key Features

### 1. **View Patient Records**
- Click "Patients" in the navigation
- Search or select any patient
- Access the Clinical Workspace for comprehensive clinical tools

### 2. **Clinical Workspace Features**
- **Notes**: Create clinical documentation
- **Orders**: Place medication, lab, and imaging orders
- **Results**: View lab results and observations
- **Tasks**: Manage clinical tasks
- **Inbox**: View clinical messages
- **Appointments**: Schedule patient appointments

### 3. **FHIR Explorer**
- Navigate to FHIR Explorer
- Browse all FHIR resources
- View raw JSON data
- Test FHIR search parameters

### 4. **Real-time Features**
- Open multiple browser tabs
- Create an order in one tab
- See real-time updates in other tabs
- Check notification badge for new alerts

## Known Limitations

1. **Authentication**: Using simplified auth for testing (not production-ready)
2. **Some Features**: Marked as "Under Construction" (billing, reports, etc.)
3. **Performance**: Development mode may be slower than production

## Troubleshooting

### If login doesn't work:
1. Ensure backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Use one of the pre-configured test providers

### If data doesn't load:
1. Check that PostgreSQL is running
2. Verify FHIR resources were imported
3. Check browser network tab for failed requests

### To view logs:
```bash
# Backend logs (if using Docker)
docker logs emr-backend

# Frontend console
# Open browser developer tools (F12)
```

## Next Steps

The system is ready for:
1. Testing clinical workflows
2. Evaluating FHIR compliance
3. Demonstrating EMR functionality
4. Development of additional features

All core functionality has been implemented and the system demonstrates a modern, FHIR-compliant EMR architecture.
