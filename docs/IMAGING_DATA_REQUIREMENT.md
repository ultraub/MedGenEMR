# Imaging Data Requirement - Action Required

## Issue Summary

During the AWS deployment update, it was discovered that the imaging data generation requirement was not fully implemented. The deployment currently has 109 patients but **lacks comprehensive imaging studies from Synthea**.

## Current Status

- ✅ **Patients**: 109 Synthea-generated patients
- ✅ **FHIR R4 API**: Working correctly  
- ✅ **CDS Hooks**: 11 services available
- ❌ **Imaging Data**: Only 1 test DICOM study (not from Synthea)

## Required Actions

### 1. Complete Imaging Data Implementation

The deployment must include imaging studies generated from Synthea data for a complete medical records system. This includes:

- **X-Ray studies** (Chest, Knee, etc.)
- **CT scans** (Head, Chest, Abdomen)  
- **MRI studies** (Brain, Spine)
- **Ultrasound studies**

### 2. Updated Deployment Process

The `update-aws-deployment.sh` script has been updated to include imaging data generation, but the current AWS server needs to be redeployed with the complete process:

```bash
# Run the complete deployment process
./update-aws-deployment.sh

# Or manually:
# 1. Stop backend
# 2. Generate Synthea data with imaging
# 3. Import FHIR data including imaging orders
# 4. Generate DICOM studies from imaging orders
# 5. Restart backend
```

### 3. Docker Container Requirements

The production container needs:
- **Java 8+** for Synthea execution
- **Synthea JAR** downloaded and available
- **Imaging generation scripts** executed after patient import

## Technical Details

### Root Cause
1. Synthea data import completed successfully (109 patients)
2. Imaging data generation script exists but failed due to database locks
3. The script attempts to create imaging studies but encounters SQLite locking issues
4. Current production container lacks Java for Synthea re-execution

### Files Updated
- `update-aws-deployment.sh` - Added imaging data generation step
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md` - Documented FHIR routing fixes
- This file documenting the imaging requirement

### Database Structure Available
```sql
-- Imaging-related tables exist:
dicom_studies        (for DICOM metadata)
imaging_studies      (for study records)  
imaging_results      (for results)
dicom_instances      (for DICOM files)
imaging_orders       (for orders from Synthea)
```

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete AWS Deployment**: Run full redeployment with imaging data
2. **Verify Imaging**: Ensure 50+ imaging studies across multiple patients
3. **Test DICOM Viewer**: Confirm imaging functionality in Clinical Workspace
4. **Update Documentation**: Reflect complete imaging support

## Validation Criteria

A complete deployment should have:
- ✅ 100+ patients from Synthea
- ✅ FHIR R4 compliance with all endpoints working
- ✅ CDS Hooks functional (11+ services)
- ✅ **50+ imaging studies** across multiple patients and modalities
- ✅ DICOM viewer functional with sample studies
- ✅ Complete clinical workflows including imaging orders

## Repository Status

Current commits include:
- Fixed FHIR routing configuration
- Updated deployment scripts with imaging requirements  
- Documentation of known issues and fixes
- Ready for merge to master with imaging requirement noted

**Next**: Complete the imaging data requirement before final production deployment.
